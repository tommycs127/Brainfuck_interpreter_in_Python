# Brainfuck interpreter in Python
An attempt to write a Brainfuck Interpreter in Python. Not sure if it works perfectly.

To use it, import it and create a Brainfuck() object. Then use .run("<code>") to run the Brainfuck code.
  
Or you can just take the .run() function out, rename it, and directly use it as an independent function.
